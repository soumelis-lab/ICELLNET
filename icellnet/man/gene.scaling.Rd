\title{Gene scaling}
\usage{
gene.scaling(data = data, n = n, db = db)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Matrix of transcriptomic profiles}

\item{n}{Number of highest expression values selected to define the maximum value of expression for the scaling}

\item{db}{Ligand/receptor database}
}
\description{
This function rescale each gene expression across condition to range from 0 to 10.
}
\details{
Select genes from transcriptional profiles corresponding to the ligands and/or
receptors included in the database (db). Then, scale each ligand/receptor
gene expression among all the conditions ranging from 0 to 10.
For each gene:
- the maximum value (10) is defined as the mean expression of the 'n' highest values of expression.
- the minimum value (0) is defined as the mean expression of the 'n' lowest values of expression.
Default value of n is 1.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{In this example, our matrix (CC.data) contains 80 transcriptional profiles.
The n is set to 4 in order to take the mean of the 5\% extreme expression values as the maximum/minimum expression value.
mean(4 highest values) --> 10
mean(4 lowest values) --> 0
gene.scaling (data = CC.data, n=4, db = db)
}
