\title{ligand.average.RNAseq function}
\usage{
ligand.average.RNAseq(db = db, data = data)
}
\arguments{
\item{db}{Ligand/receptor database}

\item{data}{A dataframe of transcriptomic profiles with gene names as rownames}
}
\description{
Compute the average expression for all ligands expressed in dataset provided, only available for RNA-seq dataset with gene symbol annotation.
}
\details{
This function returns the mean of expression of each ligand (included in the database db) of several transcriptomic profiles that should
correspond to the same biological condition. If the ligand is composed of several subunits, the function computes the geometric mean of expression
of the mean values obtained for each subunits.

\dontrun{ ligand.average.RNAseq ( db=db, data = data)}
